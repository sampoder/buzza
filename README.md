Buzza is a web app made for Quiz Bowl teams who are unable to access physical buzzers. It provides a virtual alternative.

## Usage

Visit this [website](https://buzza.sampoder.com/) to use the website.

To use the app, a teacher or club leader should begin a game by clicking ‚Äúnew game‚Äù. Then a random game ID will be generated. Participants should enter this ID along with a username to join the game. Then the teacher/club leader needs to enable the buzzers by clicking the ‚ÄúEnable Buzzers‚Äù button on the leader dashboard. Then when someone wants to buzz they simply click the big ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù button. Then once they are done giving their answer either they can disengage the buzzer or the leader can.

## Technology Used

This website uses Node.js/express. It uses Socket.io to enable real-time communication between devices. The frontend is designed with plain HTML & CSS.

## Context

This was built at MLH's NotUniversity Hacks. I am an avid participant in my school's quiz bowl team. Sadly we don't have any buzzers and purchasing buzzers for the whole team costs upwards of $1,000. I built this app so teams like mine can practise quiz bowl without a large upfront cost.
